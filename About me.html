At the begging of the 2007 summer I started my life in London. During my time in secondary school I find out that I am passionate about business and management.</p>
    <p>From early year my life was always active. I enjoy a lot of different type of sports. At age of 5 my father involve me in Karate DO where I started develop my interest in being an active.
