			<div class='leftCol'><p>I am trilingual.My first language is Latvian and my second is English but my third language is Russian. My home-town is  Jelgava (Latvia) where I spend my childhood. At the begging of the 2007 summer I started my life in London. During my time in secondary school I find out that I am passionate about business and management.</p>
    <p>From early year my life was always active. I enjoy a lot of different type of sports. At age of 5 my father involve me in Karate DO where I started develop my interest in being an active. An active lifestyle is what I believe is a key to come up with a new ideas, mature and reach unreachable. Later on when I got older I started to enjoy other sports such as free run and acrobatic.</p>
